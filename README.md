# Welcome to the ASDP Github!


## Getting Started
Documentation and Wiki has been created by Sarah. This will detail where to get started with all the software.
You will also be able to learn about how the current drone systems work (Hornet, Bumblebee, and Gimbal). 
I'd highly reccomend leaving plenty of time to get to grips with all this stuff. 
But hopefully the wiki will mean you need to spend less time. 

Jan's been in charge of the coding, and you'll find his code within this repository. Documentation for it all is available on the wiki.

## asdp4_hornet

Right, this is Jan's messy code for ASDP4. Only delve deeper if you're not squeamish...

## Bumblebee
add some useful jazzy words

## Gimbal
